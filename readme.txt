== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I have to pay for Meg? =
Standard Apps in the Meg App Store at Meg.com are free to use, and they will always be free. Premium Apps will be available on a per-app and subscription basis. Our Meg Wordpress Plugin is also free to use.

= Do I need to be a designer or developer to use Meg? =
No, Meg is designed as a simple, easy, DIY solution for mobile marketing. The Meg Wordpress Plugin will help you install the single JavaScript that is needed to add Meg to your website (we can help you with this if you'd like). From there, you'll manage your mobile marketing efforts entirely through the Meg Manager dashboard without needing to write a single line of code.

= What types of businesses can Meg help with mobile marketing? =
Meg Apps are flexible and infinitely customizable, making it an ideal solution for any business type or size. Retailers, restaurants, lawyers, contractors, event managers, bloggers, publishers, political candidates - the list goes on. Each different type of business will want to use a slightly different group of Meg Apps depending on what the business sells or does, and Meg can help grow that business starting from the day it's set up.

= Will Meg affect my website design or performance? =
On websites, Meg sits as an interactive, unobtrusive layer on top of your site. It will have no impact on the performance of your website; just the improvement of your business metrics for the site. Within social media channels, Meg is fully compatible in-stream on Facebook, Twitter, and other stream-based networks. Within a native iOS or Android mobile app, Meg acts very consistently to the website experience, sitting on top of the interface as an unobtrusive interaction layer that your business controls through the Meg Manager. Finally, in-store and on-premise through Beacons, Meg can be deployed based on your potential customer's proximity, and the Meg Apps you've set up will be triggered on that person's mobile device through a notification.

= Does Meg appear on my desktop site, too, and not just my mobile site? =
Yes, Meg is available across all devices, including the desktop. Through the Meg Manager, you can determine exactly how, where, and when Meg Apps appear to your customers and potential customers. Simply check or uncheck the boxes next to 'Desktop,' 'Phone,' and 'Tablet' to decide when Meg Apps will appear.

= I already have a mobile responsive theme in my site. Will Meg help me? =
Absolutely. A mobile responsive site is an excellent and important step for any business, but Meg does much more. Meg lets you add interactive marketing apps to your site, customize them in seconds, and manage them in real-time through the Meg Manager. You don't need to call a designer or coder to make updates or launch campaigns - manage everything on the fly and simplify your marketing efforts.

You can click on the Support tab on Meg.com, give us a call at 1-844-MEG-HELP, or send us an email at support@meg.com. We'll get back to you ASAP!
